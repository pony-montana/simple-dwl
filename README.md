# simple-dwl
wayland dwm clone; this is just my simple setup/clone.
features:
- full ipc-protocol-v2 support (in dwl and in dwl-bar), so you can click on the bar with your mouse and move across your desktops.
- support enabled for xwayland.
- swallow (hiding terminals under their child windows) and other things that makes the wm usable for me.
- clipboard unified across programs, in particular the function in the zsh.rc that makes copy-pasting in the terminals to use wl-clipboard.
- some choices are specific for my machine: a thinkpad x200 with uk keyboard running gentoo and wayland.
