# simple-dwl
wayland dwm clone; this is just my simple setup/clone.
Programs included:
- my setup/clone of dwl.
- my setup/clone of dwl-bar, a clone of the dwm default bar.
- my setup/clone of someblocks, a clone of dwmblocks. Just two simple and ugly blocks to put on the bar, just to show how it works. 

Features:
- full ipc-protocol-v2 support (in dwl and in dwl-bar), so you can click on the bar with your mouse and move across your desktops.
- support enabled for xwayland.
- swallow (hiding terminals under their child windows) and other things that makes the wm usable for me.
- clipboard unified across programs, in particular the function in the .zshrc that makes the "copy-pasting in the terminals" to use wl-clipboard.
- some choices are specific for my machine: a thinkpad x200 with uk keyboard running gentoo and (obviously) wayland.
- a beautiful wallpaper, the Tower of Babel of Pieter Bruegel. I picked it from www.wikipedia.org.

To complete your setup, you probably will need some programs from https://github.com/natpen/awesome-wayland.

I happily use:
- foot (wayland terminal)
- zsh (shell)
- imv (image viewer)
- zathura (pdf viewer)
- swaybg (wallpaper selector)
- swaylock (to lock your pc when you are away)
- wl-clipboard (simple clipboard for wayland)
- other common stuffs.
